Hi, I'm Marc Almeda, an aspiring cybersecurity professional and fresh graduate from the University of Wollongong. 
I started this GitHub Pages website to document my cybersecurity learning journey and showcase my portfolio and achievements.
You'll be able to find what I have worked on in the past and what I am working on now.
Writeups about my old projects, HTB walkthroughs and experiences in cybersecurity will be on this platform.

In the future, I hope that this website will be useful to not only me, but the wider community as well.
I'm not an expert and might never be, but as I go along, I hope to fill this website with more writeups and
experiences that the community will appreciate.
